# Script character extractor

Use this script to extract the dialogs from any movie script and get different
files for every character.

## Usage

Running `node cli.js --help` will get you what you need to get started. An
example would be:

    node cli.js ~/movie_script.html

that will create a folder named `movie_script` in the same directory with a txt
file for every character.
